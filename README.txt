Employee Management System (EMS) is a coding project I've developed for my diploma final year project. It is written in C# and uses MySQL as its database.

EMS has 5 modules which are:
1. Login
2. Manage
3. Attendance
4. Payroll
5. Leave

There are 2 kind of user accounts in this system:
1. admin (built-in administrator account)
2. employee (every employee has their own account)
** There is only one admin account and its credentials are immutable.

Admin account's credentials:
username: admin
password: admin

Remember to import the database into XAMPP Control Panel (MySQL). The database file name is database.sql.

Feel free to download the code and explore!!
